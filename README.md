# RepRap Chinampa

Passive self-watering 3D-printable floating vegetable pot, inspired by the chinampa (floating garden bed).

## 3D Printing Notes

### 3D Printer (Hardware) Configuration/Modifications

The models have been successfully printed in Natural PLA on a Prusa Mk3S+ using a 0.4mm nozzle with an upgraded part cooling duct (See https://www.printables.com/model/906613-highv-part-cooling-duct-for-prusa-i3-mk3s)

### Print Profile / Slicing

The models have been successfully printed using the following profile with "vase mode" enabled. Note that the profile is for a 0.8 mm nozzle, but have been physically tested on a 0.4 mm nozzle.

    Nozzle diameter: 0.8 mm nozzle
    Layer height: 0.2 mm
    Top fill pattern: Concentric
    Bottom fill pattern: Concentric
    Infill speed: 5 mm/s
    Solid infill speed: 5 mm/s
    Top solid infill speed: 5 mm/s
    First layer speed: 5 mm/s
    Max print speed: 30 mm/s
    Overhang speed:
        0% overlap(bridge): 15 mm/s
        25% overlap: 1 mm/s
        50% overlap: 1 mm/s
        75% overlap: 2 mm/s
    Extrusion multiplier: 1.2
    Nozzle temperature:
        First layer: 230 C
        Other layers: 230 C
    Bed temperature:
        First layer: 60 C
        Other layers: 60 C
    Fan speed:
