## 3D Printing Notes

### 3D Printer (Hardware) Configuration/Modifications

The models have been successfully printed on a Prusa Mk3S+ using a 0.4mm nozzle with an upgraded part cooling duct (See https://www.printables.com/model/906613-highv-part-cooling-duct-for-prusa-i3-mk3s)

## Print Profile / Slicing
